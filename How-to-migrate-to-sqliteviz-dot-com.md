# How to migrate to sqliteviz.com

All upcoming sqliteviz releases will be deployed on sqliteviz.com instead of
[Github Pages](https://lana-k.github.io/sqliteviz/#/). The saved inquiries that
you still care about can be imported to sqliteviz.com as usual.

## Step 1: export inquiries

- Click `Inquiries` in the main top menu
- Select all inquiries by clicking the checkbox in the table header
- Click `Export` and save your inquires in a JSON file

## Step 2: uninstall sqliteviz

If you installed sqliteviz as PWA uninstall it before install the new version.

- Go to `chrome://apps/` in your browser
- Right click on sqliteviz icon
- Choose `Remove from Chrome`

## Step 3: import inquires

- Go to [https://sqliteviz.com/app/#/workspace](https://sqliteviz.com/app/#/workspace)
- Click `Inquiries` in the main top menu
- Click `Import`
- Choose the file where you exported your inquires
